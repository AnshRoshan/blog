# blog

Static blog for [anshroshan.com](https://anshroshan.com), built with Astro.

- **Fully static**: every page is pre-rendered at build time from Sanity CMS —
  the deployed site is plain HTML/CSS with zero client-side JavaScript.
- **Content** lives in Sanity (same dataset as before). Post bodies are
  Portable Text, rendered to HTML at build time.
- **Pages**: writing index (`/`), posts (`/blog/[slug]`), tag archives
  (`/tags`, `/tags/[tag]`), RSS (`/rss.xml`), sitemap.

## Setup

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID
npm run dev
```

Without a Sanity project id the site still builds and runs — pages just show
their empty states. Deploy target: any static host (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare
Pages) with `dist/` as the output directory.

## Writing

The Sanity Studio lives in `studio/` inside this repo:

```sh
cd studio
npm install
npm run dev        # local studio at http://localhost:3333
npm run deploy     # optional: host it at a free *.sanity.studio URL
```

Publish a post in the Studio, then rebuild/redeploy the site (wire a Sanity
webhook to your host's deploy hook for automatic publishing).
